# Chapter I: HTML Basics
If you have created the basic HTML Skeleton you can start to add an image to the HTML Page. 

```html
<img src="<<sourcePathToTheImage>>">
```
If you take a closer look to the img tag you see the 'src' part, this is called an attribute and you will need it a lot in Web Development.

Attributes contains additional information about an element that you do not want to appear in the actual content of the page.

# Chapter II: Ordered List vs Unordered List
To create a list in HTML you can use the following tags

```HTML
<ol>    Ordered List    </ol>
<ul>   Unordered List  </ul>
<li>    List Element    </li>
```
